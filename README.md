## About FYP
The aim of this module is to allow students to apply their knowledge and practical skills culminated throughout their studies in the course. Students will demonstrate the knowledge, technical skillsets and critical thinking that they have learned to develop, depending on their specialisation, Full-Slack, Blockchain or AI solution for authentic industry problem. This will include the full development cycle start from requirement analysis, to conceptualisation, to system design, to prototyping, to testing and finally to 'live' deployment.

Bhutan today boasts of harboring 5,369 plant species and 5,114 species of animals of which about 774 species are birds. Many Birds of Bhutan are rare birds of the world. Owing to Bhutanâ€™s strict nature and conservation policies, the bird population in Bhutan is growing. It has become the envy of birders and researchers from across the globe. The protected wildlife parks and sanctuaries and designated biological corridors have also been pivotal in ensuring that the birds are safe and thriving.

Even though the country is rich in bird diversity, there is a need for a proper platform to store and share more accurate and up-to-date information on bird populations and distributions because the birdwatchers currently record their sightings in personal notebooks, making it difficult for researchers to access and analyze this valuable data.

Druk eBird aims to address the lack of comprehensive and up-to-date information on the bird species, abundance and distribution in and around Bhutan. The researchers are finding it difficult to fetch accurate data on populations, abundance, location and distribution of the birds. It will provide a centralized platform on bird sighting and observation for collecting and sharing bird observation data in a standardized format, making it easier to compare and analyze data from different sources. 

## About the app
The DrukEBird app is a mobile application developed using React Native, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. It is designed to cater to birding enthusiasts and encourage Bhutanese people to engage in birding activities.
